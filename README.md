# HEX2BASIC


This simple program allows you to convert HEX file into Commodore 64 Basic file with poke commands that put the programm written in hex into C64's memory.

You can use emulator to convert basic file to prg (C64 executable) file and then either put it on SD card and use floppy emulator or just use PRG2WAV converter to record it on tape.



Content of hex file has to be copied into the terminal window with running program, with space between every byte of data. Writing 666 at the end causes program to start conversion.


BASIC.bas is the output file.
